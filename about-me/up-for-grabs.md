# Up for grabs

## ManagerBot Avatar

Bot is refactored, it will move to version beta 3.0 soon. Code is getting better and better but the representative icon, that should be something super ultra cool is the same and it's becoming obsolete. Let's change it! Create your personalized version of Bot Avatar. Send it to me, i can help you with how it should look like but you are the one who makes it. 

Good Luck!

#### Description:

* Square Format - minimal resolution 400x400
* Use High contrast colors
* Theme: Bot Face or some shortened version of ManagerBot – Capital "M" or something similar
* PNG format
* without watermarks
* License

TerrestrialHeaven is a home for ManagerBot and also for a small size gaming community. Avatar is a thing that should be very specific and it is one of the most important things connected with server. Create your personalized version of Server Icon. Send it to me, i can help you with how it should look like but you are the one who makes it. 

Good Luck!
